# Desription 

This is a frogger type game. This is a very simple game when the player reaches the other side without dying they up thier score by 200.  enemies should move faster as the score climbs higher.  When the player dies he is reset to the start and losses a life. When all lives are lost the game resets.  

# Credits 
I would like to give credit to the following tutorial which helped me understand the base concepts Ben Cunningham's tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PHhRrjgTDA.  I then added the score, hearts, lost lives, and increase enemy speed based on the concepts I learned.
